Javascript: it's client side script used to apply dynamic changes on web page, like event programming, animations, validations(user restriction) etc.

It is an event based script, used to apply dynamic changes on web page, where event refers to activity which will be performed on web page to get dynamic changes and this event will leads to access specific functionality.

Script: execution->not compliled  -> execute directly on browser -> interpreted
Program: compile -> execution

Variables: storage -> used to store value for the execution of program -> stores data
In JS Variables are known as Reference Variables
var var_name = value;
var a = 100;
var stands for variant -> can store different types of data.

JS -> fully object oriented

variables, functions etc -> references

Why variables are known as References?
In c :  a = 2 , b = 2 , here both a and b will have different memory
In JS :  a = 2 , b = 2 , here both a and b will refer to same memory(where 2(data) is stored) -> intelligent interpreter


Data types are managed internally in JS:

Primary data types
1) number
2) string
3) boolean

User data types
1) Array
2) Object

client side scripting -> .html extension
server side scripting -> .js extension
